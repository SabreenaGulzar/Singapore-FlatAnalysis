# SingaporeResaleFlatPricePrediction
Project Overview:
Objective:

To predict the resale prices of HDB flats based on various features such as flat type, floor area, lease commencement date, location, and proximity to amenities.
Data Collection:

The project uses historical HDB resale transaction data, which typically includes details like transaction date, flat type, block number, street name, floor area, lease commencement date, resale price, and other relevant features.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as the age of the flat, floor level, or location-based features. Convert categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalization: Scale numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the prediction model.
Modeling:

A machine learning model, such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, or Gradient Boosting, is trained on the processed dataset to predict resale prices.
Hyperparameter Tuning: The model's performance is optimized by adjusting hyperparameters to achieve better accuracy.
Model Evaluation:

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and cross-validation to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Prediction:

The final model can predict resale prices for new or unseen flats, helping potential buyers and sellers estimate the market value of HDB flats.
Outcome:
The project provides a reliable tool for predicting HDB resale prices, which can be used by policymakers, real estate agents, and potential buyers to make informed decisions.
This project not only demonstrates the application of machine learning in the real estate domain but also provides valuable insights into the factors influencing flat prices in Singapore.
